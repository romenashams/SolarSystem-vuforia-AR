# SolarSystem-vuforia-AR
This project explores the integration of Vuforia with Unity to create augmented reality (AR) applications that can handle occlusions with multi-targets. The project includes several exercises to demonstrate the tracking and detection of 3D models from various angles, and how occlusions are managed within an augmented scene.
