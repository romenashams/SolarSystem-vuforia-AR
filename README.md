# SolarSeystem-Vuforia-AR

## Overview
This project explores the integration of Vuforia with Unity to create augmented reality (AR) applications that can handle occlusions with multi-targets. The project includes several exercises to demonstrate the tracking and detection of 3D models from various angles, and how occlusions are managed within an augmented scene.

## Features
- **Object Recognition**: Utilizes Vuforia to recognize objects by their shapes using pre-existing 3D models, either from CAD models or 3D scans.
- **Multi-Target Tracking**: Implements multi-target configurations to enable tracking of complex geometric arrangements from multiple angles.
- **Occlusion Handling**: Demonstrates the capability of Vuforia and Unity to handle occlusions, enhancing the realism in augmented reality scenes.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Unity 2019.4 or newer
- Vuforia Engine AR
- Access to Vuforia Target Manager for creating and managing Multi Targets

### Installation
- **Clone the Repository**: git clone https://github.com/romenashams/SolarSeystem-Vuforia-AR.git
- **Open with Unity:** Open the cloned repository in Unity.
- **Set Up Vuforia:** Ensure Vuforia is enabled in the Unity project settings and set up your license key.
  
### Running the Experiments
- **Exercise 1:** Place a Multi-Target in the scene and observe the handling of occlusions with basic shapes.
- **Exercise 2:** Enhance the scene with textured spheres that rotate around the box to simulate a dynamic environment.
- **Exercise 3:** Expand the previous setup by adding multiple spheres at various distances to create a complex "solar system" simulation.
